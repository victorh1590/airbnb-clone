# Tem Vaga Aí?

"Tem Vaga Aí?" was my first attempt to build a fullstack website. It was a college project. I developed this website in raw **HTML/CSS/Javascript** and **PHP** in the back-end. I used **JQuery and AJAX** too, built my own menus, navbars, header/footer, containers. I used **MariaDB (MySQL)** as the database and hosted the site using an Apache web server on my machine. This was also my first **CRUD**, containing a fully functional control panel to manipulate advertises.

I learned a lot of things with this project, but the most important lesson was: **Organizing a project is very hard!**
Going through the files in this project you'll see lots of **mistakes**, like a hardcoded db_connection string and credentials (yep).
The main javascript file is huge and unorganized. It's very difficult to find anything in there and understand what is going on.
There are los of redundancy in the HTML and CSS files too.

Anyway, In retrospect, it was very productive for me, I learned a lot and improved a lot since this project. It helped me to understand why people use **frameworks** instead of building their own things from scratch. But I also learned __"Hey, I can build things myself **IF NECESSARY**, but it will demand a lot of work and extra time to refactor, design and organize everything"__.

The site also had a lot of images that I obtained on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). Obviously i'm not commiting binaries.

I'm not going to make a guide teaching how to run the website. In essence you need the Apache web server, a SQL database, some placeholder
images and a browser. You can use **phpmyadmin** to configure your database like I did. Some extra details can be found in the about.html file (in portuguese).
